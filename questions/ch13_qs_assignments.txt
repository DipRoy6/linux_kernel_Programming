Chapter 13 : Questions and/or Assignments

1. miscdrv_rdwr_refcount
Modify our earlier ch12/2_miscdrv_rdwr_spinlock/miscdrv_rdwr_spinlock.c
driver code; it has the integers ga and gb , which, when being read or
written were protected via a spinlock. Now make them refcount variables
(initializing them to some value, say, 42) and use the appropriate
refcount_t methods when working on them.
Include a test case where you deliberately make them go outside the valid
allowed range ([1..INT_MAX-1]).

2. If you haven't already, configure and build a "debug" kernel (ensure you
have the Lock Debugging config options enabled, as we explained in
the 'Configuring a debug kernel for lock debugging' section of this chapter).
Now, boot from it and try out a buggy kernel module (that has locking/deadlock
bugs); lockdep should catch and report this.
