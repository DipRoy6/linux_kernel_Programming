Chapter 7 : Questions and/or Assignments


For added value, we have also provided, in the solutions_to_assignments/ch7/
directory of this book's GitHub repo, three (well-stitched!) screenshots
of the procmap utility's complete output when running procmap on the bash process on:
- a native x86_64 Ubuntu (22.04 LTS) box with 32 GB RAM
- an AArch64 Raspberry Pi 4B running a 64-bit kernel
- an AArch32 TI BeagleBone Black board with 512 MB RAM
Be sure to have a look at these exciting screenshots!


1. View the user VAS of the init or systemd process on your Linux box:
  a. First, via its proc entries (maps for one line per mapping and
     smaps for detailed info for each mapping or segment).
  b. Use one or more frontend utilities to perform the same lookup.
  In both cases, study and interpret the output.
  
2. Use the smem utility to figure out which process (or processes) is/are
the memory hogger(s) on your system (tip: read the documentation on the smem
utility's home page).

3. Run the ch7/show_kernel_seg kernel module on your x86_64 system
(also enable showing the user space details via the module parameter
provided); study the output and understand the memory map it displays.

4. Clone and run the more powerful procmap utility
(https://github.com/kaiwan/procmap) on your x86_64 system; study the
output and understand the complete memory map it effectively displays.
Bonus points for running it on other Linux systems as well.
