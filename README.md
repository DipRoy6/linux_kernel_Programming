# Linux Kernel Programming, Second Edition
This is the code repository for [Linux Kernel Programming, Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/product/linux-kernel-programming-second-edition/9781803232225), published by Packt.

**A comprehensive and practical guide to kernel internals, writing modules, and kernel synchronization**

The author of this book is - [Kaiwan N. Billimoria](https://in.linkedin.com/in/kaiwanbillimoria) 
## About the book

The 2nd Edition of Linux Kernel Programming is an updated, comprehensive guide for new programmers to the Linux kernel. This book uses the recent 6.1 Long-Term Support (LTS) Linux kernel series, which will be maintained until Dec 2026, and also delves into its many new features. Further, the Civil Infrastructure Project has pledged to maintain and support this 6.1 Super LTS (SLTS) kernel right until August 2033, keeping this book valid for years to come!

You’ll begin this exciting journey by learning how to build the kernel from source. In a step by step manner, you will then learn how to write your first kernel module by leveraging the kernel’s powerful Loadable Kernel Module (LKM) framework. With this foundation, you will delve into key kernel internals topics including Linux kernel architecture, memory management, and CPU (task) scheduling. You’ll finish with understanding the deep issues of concurrency, and gain insight into how they can be addressed with various synchronization/locking technologies (e.g., mutexes, spinlocks, atomic/refcount operators, rw-spinlocks and even lock-free technologies such as per-CPU and RCU).

By the end of this book, you’ll have a much better understanding of the fundamentals of writing the Linux kernel and kernel module code that can straight away be used in real-world projects and products.

## Key Takeaways

## Software and hardware list

These are the software packages (and relevant version numbers) used:
- x86_64 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and guest OS (running on Oracle VirtualBox 7.0)
- x86_64 Ubuntu 23.04 LTS guest OS (running on Oracle VirtualBox 7.0)
- x86_64 Fedora 38 (and 39) on a native (laptop) system
- ARM Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (64-bit, running both its “distro” kernel as well as our custom 6.1 kernel); lightly tested

## Known Errata

- page 9:
    - The phrase 'the 6.1 kernel is a Long-Term Stable (LTS) version', should be
    'the 6.1 kernel is a Long-Term *Support* (LTS) version'.

## Get to know the Authors
_Kaiwan N. Billimoria_ taught himself BASIC programming on his dad's IBM PC back in 1983. He was programming in C and Assembly on DOS until he discovered the joys of Unix, and by around 1997, Linux!
Kaiwan has worked on many aspects of the Linux system programming stack, including Bash scripting, system programming in C, kernel internals, device drivers, and embedded Linux work. He has actively worked on several commercial/FOSS projects. His contributions include drivers to the mainline Linux OS and many smaller projects hosted on GitHub. His Linux passion feeds well into his passion for teaching these topics to engineers, which he has done for well over two decades now. He's also the author of Hands-On System Programming with Linux, Linux Kernel Programming (and its Part 2 book) and Linux Kernel Debugging. It doesn't hurt that he is a recreational ultrarunner too.
