Readme (for ch8/slab4_actualsz_wstg_plot)

Refers to material covered in LKP 2E, Ch 8, Kernel Memory Allocation for Module
Authors, Part 1, section 'Graphing it'.

Steps to follow to plot the graph (of
 X-axis: required size to allocate (bytes) vs
 Y-axis: wastage percentage that occurs when allocating using slab APIs):

0. Firstly, you need to be running a recent Linux distro in GUI mode and have
the gnuplot package installed

1. Ensure you first clear the kernel log
sudo dmesg -C

2. Now build the module and insmod it (it will fail at some point, that's fine)
../../lkm slab4_actualsz_wstg_plot

3. Run the helper script plot_graph.sh; f.e.:

(Recommended: Before running the script, pl check the data file; it should ONLY
have data of the form:
100,28
20580,59
41060,59
[...]
4137060,1
4157540,0

If any unwanted lines exist (typically output from the kernel WARN*() macro,
delete them).
Note that the script is designed to auto-eliminate unwanted lines, just mentioning
this as an additional safety.

Now run the plot script:

$ ./plot_graph.sh 
Done, generated data file for gnuplot: plotdata.txt

Done.
